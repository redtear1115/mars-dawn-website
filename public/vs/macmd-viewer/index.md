# MacMD Viewer vs. MarsDawn.

Both are Mac apps for reading Markdown rendered. MacMD Viewer opens a `.md` file and shows the finished page; it doesn't edit it. MarsDawn puts an editor next to the same kind of rendered preview, so you write and review in one window. Here's how they differ, feature by feature.

## If you only need to read, not edit

If your job is strictly reading Markdown someone else wrote, and you never need to touch the source, MacMD Viewer is a reasonable fit: it's built for exactly that, is available now and works down to an older macOS. MarsDawn is worth it once reading isn't the whole job, because an agent's Markdown usually comes back for another pass.

## What each app does

|  | MacMD Viewer | MarsDawn |
|---|---|---|
| Editing | Read-only by design | Edits the source, with the rendered page beside it |
| Preview themes | 12 document themes | 4 themes, each with a light and a dark palette |
| Diagrams and math | Mermaid and code highlighting; its listing doesn't mention math | Mermaid, code highlighting and KaTeX math |
| Quick Look in Finder | Yes | Yes |
| PDF and print | Yes | Yes |
| Requires | macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later | macOS 26 (Tahoe) or later |
| Interface languages | Not stated in its own materials | English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese and Japanese |

## Pricing and how you buy it
