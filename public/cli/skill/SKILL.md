description: Export Markdown to PDF with the marsdawn command-line tool on macOS and read its JSON result, and open Markdown you wrote in MarsDawn for the user to review. Use when asked to turn a Markdown file into a PDF, or to render Markdown with tables, math, Mermaid diagrams or highlighted code into a PDF. Also use after writing or revising a Markdown document the user will read, to open it in MarsDawn for review.

# marsdawn

`marsdawn export` renders a Markdown file to PDF on macOS 15 or later. It needs nothing else
installed, not even the MarsDawn app.

## Install and check

```sh
command -v marsdawn || brew install redtear1115/tap/marsdawn
marsdawn --version
```

Use the version it prints. Don't assume one. On Apple silicon Homebrew pours a prebuilt bottle;
on an Intel Mac it builds from source and needs Xcode 26 or later. If the install stops with
"A full installation of Xcode.app 26.0 is required", say so rather than retrying.

## Export

```sh
marsdawn export input.md --json
```

Options: `-o out.pdf` (default: beside the input), `--theme dawn|classic|modern|vivid`,
`--paper a4|letter`, `--force` to replace an existing PDF, and
`--allow-remote-images` to load web images, which are left out by default.

On success it exits 0 and prints one JSON line:

- `ok`: always true
- `output`: Absolute path of the PDF that was written.
- `pages`: Number of pages in the PDF.
- `theme`: Theme used for the export.
- `paper`: Paper size used for the export.
- `diagramErrors`: One message per Mermaid diagram that failed to render. The PDF is still written.
- `diagramErrorDetails`: The same failures as `diagramErrors`, in the same order, each as
  `{message, fenceLine, line}`. `fenceLine` is the document line the diagram's fence starts on,
  present whenever that's known. `line` is the document line of the error itself (`fenceLine` plus
  Mermaid's own line number from its message), present only when Mermaid's message names a line —
  some errors, like an undetected diagram type, don't. Either can be absent on its own.

If `diagramErrors` isn't empty, the PDF was still written: tell the user which diagrams failed.

## Themes

`marsdawn theme validate theme.json --json` checks a MarsDawn theme file with the app's own
validator; exit 1 means invalid, with each problem under `issues`. `--require-complete` is the
check for a theme to publish. `marsdawn theme css theme.json --json` prints the CSS the preview
serves for a valid theme, as `variables` and `rules`. `marsdawn theme preview theme.json --appearance light -o preview.png`
renders a sample document with the theme to a PNG (`--appearance light|dark`, `--width` 600–2000,
default 1200; `--force` replaces an existing PNG). All three refuse a symlinked or oversized theme
file, and an invalid theme exits 1 with its problems.

## Exit codes

On failure with `--json` it prints `{"ok": false, "error": <kind>, "message": ...}`.

| Code | `error` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | — | Success. With --json, stdout is one JSON line. |
| 1 | — | The theme isn't valid. Only the `theme` commands return this; with --json its problems are under `issues`. |
| 2 | `input_not_found` | The input file isn't there. |
| 3 | `app_not_installed` | MarsDawn isn't installed. Only `open` returns this. |
| 4 | `output_exists` | The PDF (or `theme preview`'s PNG) already exists. Pass --force to replace it, or -o to write elsewhere. |
| 5 | `export_failed` | Rendering failed. |
| 6 | `app_cannot_open_folders` | This MarsDawn can't show a folder, so nothing was opened. Only `open` returns this. |
| 64 | — | Usage error: a bad option or value. Printed as text on stderr, never as JSON, except `theme preview`'s refused -o (`output_folder_missing`, `output_symlink`, `output_not_a_file`). |

## Review: open what you wrote

After writing or revising a Markdown document the user will read, open it in the MarsDawn app,
where they read it rendered next to the source:

```sh
marsdawn open plan.md:42 --json
```

- `:42` is the line of your first change, counted from 1, so the user lands on it. Leave it off
  when the whole document is new.
- Open it **once**. When you edit the file again, the open window picks up the change by itself
  and tells the user, with Undo. Don't run `open` again after every edit.
- It needs the MarsDawn app. Without it, `open` exits 3 (`app_not_installed`): tell the user once
  and carry on. Don't retry, and don't try to install the app.
- To show the project in the window's sidebar as well, add `--folder <path>` (marsdawn 0.5.1 and
  later; one folder). The JSON then includes `"folder": {"path": ..., "requested": true}`.
  `requested` means marsdawn asked the app. It can't tell whether the sidebar shows the folder
  (the app may first ask the user for access), so report it as asked, not as done.
- Never use `open` to make a PDF: that's `export`.

### Showing a folder

`marsdawn open . --folder . --json` (or a folder path as an argument) also asks MarsDawn to show
that folder in the window's sidebar, alongside any files. With a MarsDawn that reports back, the
`folder` object in `--json` carries a `status` once the wait ends: `attached`, `needsUser` (see
`waitingFor`: `confirmation` or `folderChoice`, meaning the user has to act — don't retry, just
tell them), `declined`, `failed`, `attachedDifferentFolder`, `full`, `unavailable`, or `unknown`
(the app didn't answer in time; try again with a longer `--wait`, or treat it as "don't know").
`--wait <seconds>` sets how long to wait, 0–30, default 2; a value ArgumentParser can parse as a
number but outside that range is a usage error, exit 64, with `error: wait_out_of_range` in
`--json`. Write a negative value as `--wait=-1`, not `--wait -1`: with a space, ArgumentParser reads
it as another flag and gives its own plain usage error instead — still exit 64, but no
`wait_out_of_range`; a value too large to be a number at all gets the same plain error. `--wait 0`,
or an older MarsDawn that doesn't report
back, skips waiting: the `folder` object only carries `path` and `requested: true`, same as
before this existed.
