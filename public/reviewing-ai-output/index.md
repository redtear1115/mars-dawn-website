# An agent writes it. You still have to understand it.

An AI agent can draft a plan, a spec or a set of notes quickly. What it produces still has to be understood by the person who acts on it — not trusted because it reads fluently.

**MarsDawn is built for that read: the rendered page next to the source, with Mermaid diagrams and KaTeX math drawn out instead of left as marks, so a document's structure is legible at a glance.**

## Fluent isn't the same as correct

Writing about AI-assisted coding, Simon Willison put it this way about code that will be worked on again, not thrown away: “the quality and understandability of the underlying code is crucial” ([Vibe coding](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/6/vibe-coding/), 2025). The same holds for a document: an agent's draft that reads smoothly can still get the structure, the numbers or the logic wrong, and fluent prose doesn't announce which parts to check.

## Inference, not compilation

Birgitta Böckeler, writing for Thoughtworks, draws the distinction plainly: “LLMs are NOT compilers, interpreters, transpilers or assemblers of natural language, they are inferrers” ([I still care about the code](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/i-still-care-about-the-code.html)). A compiler either accepts your input or reports an error; an agent can hand back something that runs, or reads, without being right. Somebody still has to check it.

## What MarsDawn gives that reader

- The rendered page next to the source, updating as either side changes, so a claim in the text and the way it's structured are both in view at once.
- Mermaid diagrams drawn out: a flowchart an agent described in text becomes a shape you can actually follow.
- KaTeX math rendered, not left as a string of backslashes: a formula reads as a formula.
- Nothing runs on its own. MarsDawn doesn't grade, summarize or flag the document for you — it puts the structure in front of you so you can.

- [Agent skill](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/cli/skill/index.md): One file your coding agent loads to install marsdawn, check it works, export Markdown to PDF and read the JSON result.
- [MCP server](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/cli/mcp/index.md): marsdawn has no AI model of its own, so it doesn't matter which agent wrote the Markdown. Call it from the CLI, a skill file, or the marsdawn-mcp MCP server: all three run the same export.
- [Token-efficient review](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/token-efficient-review/index.md): A person reviews the rendered page in MarsDawn, never read back into the agent's context. The tool call itself returns a compact JSON result, not the rendered content, so calling it is cheap too.
- [Viewing Markdown elsewhere vs. MarsDawn](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/vs/markdown-preview-tools/index.md): How MarsDawn compares to reading Markdown in VS Code's built-in preview, a browser extension, or Claude Desktop's file preview: what each renders, and what it takes to open one file.
- [Preview themes and PDF export](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/themes/index.md): Four preview themes, each with a light and dark palette, and one PDF/print export that matches whichever you're in. More importable themes, and a gallery to share your own, are planned.
- [Sharing exported PDFs](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/sharing-exported-pdfs/index.md): Export an agent's Markdown to PDF and hand it to a colleague who doesn't read Markdown and won't install anything. No syntax, no app and no account needed to open it.
- [繁體中文](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/zh-hant/reviewing-ai-output/index.md): AI 寫的 Markdown 還是得由人來理解，不能因為讀起來通順就直接相信。MarsDawn 把排版後的頁面和原始碼並排，也把 Mermaid 圖表與 KaTeX 數學式畫出來，讓結構一眼就看得懂。
- [简体中文](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/zh-hans/reviewing-ai-output/index.md): AI 写的 Markdown 还是得由人来理解，不能因为读起来通顺就直接相信。MarsDawn 把排版后的页面和源代码并排，也把 Mermaid 图表与 KaTeX 数学式画出来，让结构一眼就看得懂。
- [日本語](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/ja/reviewing-ai-output/index.md): AI が書いた Markdown も、結局は人が理解しなければなりません。読みやすいからといって鵜呑みにはできません。MarsDawn はレンダリングされたページとソースを並べ、Mermaid 図と KaTeX 数式を描画するので、構造が一目で分かります。
