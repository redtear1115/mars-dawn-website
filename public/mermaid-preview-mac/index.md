# Mermaid preview on Mac.

Mermaid lets you write a diagram as text inside a Markdown file. Most editors show you the text. MarsDawn draws the diagram: in the preview next to the source, in Quick Look in Finder, and in the PDF you export.

## Write the diagram as text

Put the diagram in a code block marked `mermaid`:

````
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Write[Write Markdown] --> Preview[Live preview]
    Preview --> Export{Share it?}
    Export -- PDF --> PDF[File ▸ Export as PDF…]
    Export -- Print --> Print[File ▸ Print…]
```
````

In MarsDawn that block becomes a flowchart: Write Markdown, then Live preview, then a Share it? choice that leads to PDF or Print.

## Where the diagram is drawn

- **In the preview.** Open the file and the diagram sits next to its source (⌘2). The page updates as you type, and the two panes scroll together.
- **In Quick Look.** Select the file in Finder and press Space; diagrams are drawn there too.
- **In the PDF.** File ▸ Export as PDF… and File ▸ Print… draw the diagram into the page. Page breaks avoid cutting a diagram in half. The PDF uses the theme's light colors.
- **From the command line.** The free `marsdawn export` tool draws the same diagrams into a PDF, and does not need the app. See [Command Line](/cli/).
- **In your theme.** The preview's Appearance setting applies to diagrams too, so a diagram follows light or dark.

## When the diagram has a mistake

If Mermaid can't draw a diagram, the preview shows the diagram's source with the full error message underneath. When the error names a line, click the message and the editor jumps to that line. `marsdawn export --json` reports failed diagrams in `diagramErrors`, so a script or an agent can tell that a diagram didn't draw.

## What to know

- You edit the Mermaid text. There is no visual diagram editor, and you can't drag boxes in the preview.
- Which diagram types draw depends on the Mermaid version inside the app. MarsDawn 1.1.0 includes Mermaid 12.0.0. The kit's export tests render documents for flowcharts, sequence, class, state, entity-relationship, Gantt, pie, mindmap, journey, timeline and git graphs, among others.
- MarsDawn has no AI model, so it doesn't write a diagram for you. The [flowchart template](/templates/flowchart/) has a prompt you can hand to your own agent.

## Next

- Start from a diagram that already works: the [flowchart template](/templates/flowchart/).
- Export it: [PDF export](/pdf/), or from a script, [Command Line](/cli/).
