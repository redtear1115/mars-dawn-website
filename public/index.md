Frontier tools for builders

# Claim the map. Read the dawn.

Markdown for humans who steer agentic work.

The page shows a working MarsDawn window over part of the app's Welcome guide. Pick one of four preview themes (Dawn, Classic, Modern, Vivid) and one of three layouts (Source, Split, Preview).

## Read what your agent wrote.

1. **The agent writes.** Your coding agent or writing assistant drafts the Markdown: a README, a spec, a set of notes.
2. **You review in MarsDawn.** Open the file and read it rendered, with Mermaid diagrams and highlighted code, next to the source.
3. **The agent revises.** Ask for changes. Open the revised file and read it the same way.

## Do this now

The free `marsdawn` command-line tool is ready today. Install it with Homebrew:

```
brew install redtear1115/tap/marsdawn
```

- `marsdawn export` turns a Markdown file into a PDF, rendered like MarsDawn's preview. It doesn't need the app.
- `marsdawn open` opens files in the MarsDawn app for you to review.
- `--json` gives scripts and agents results they can parse.

- [Token-efficient review](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/token-efficient-review/index.md): A person reviews the rendered page in MarsDawn, never read back into the agent's context. The tool call itself returns a compact JSON result, not the rendered content, so calling it is cheap too.

MarsDawn pairs the rendered page with the source, and draws Mermaid diagrams and KaTeX math, so structure is legible at a glance.
