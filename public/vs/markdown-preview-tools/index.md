# Viewing Markdown elsewhere, vs. MarsDawn.

If you already have VS Code, a browser or Claude Desktop open, reaching for one of them to glance at a Markdown file is reasonable. Here's what each one actually renders, and what it costs to get there, compared with opening the same file in MarsDawn.

## At a glance

|  | VS Code preview | Browser extension | Claude Desktop | MarsDawn |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Opens a Markdown file from disk | Yes | Yes, once file access is allowed | No: Markdown isn't on its upload list | Yes |
| Before the first file | Install VS Code, a whole development environment | Install an extension, then turn on “Allow access to file URLs” | It can't browse files on disk | Install MarsDawn |
| Built for | Writing code; the preview is one pane among many | Browsing the web | Conversations with Claude | Reading and editing Markdown |
| Draws the page with | Electron: a bundled Chromium and Node.js | A full browser | The Claude Desktop app | A native AppKit app; WebKit draws the page |

## VS Code's built-in preview

Press `⌘⇧V` in VS Code and it renders the Markdown file in a built-in preview pane, free, with nothing to install. As of VS Code 1.121 (May 2026), that preview also renders Mermaid diagrams natively — Microsoft folded a Mermaid extension into VS Code itself, so this used to need a separate extension and no longer does. What it doesn't do: it's a preview pane inside an editor, not an editor built for reading — the pane sits next to a file tree, a terminal and every other panel VS Code can show, and VS Code itself is an Electron app you install as a whole development environment, not something you open to read one file.

## A browser extension for local files

No single browser extension dominates for reading a local `.md` file: Local Markdown Viewer, Markdown Viewer, MarkView and others all do roughly the same thing, and none is a default. Every one of them needs the same extra step before it can open anything: turning on "Allow access to file URLs" for that extension, because browsers block extensions from reading `file://` pages by default. That's a permission you grant once per extension, and it's easy to forget you did it, or why. Once it's on, the file renders in a browser tab, which means running a full browser to look at one file.

## Claude Desktop's file preview

Claude Desktop shows a file that's already in a Project or a conversation. What it isn't built for is browsing arbitrary files on disk — what you can look at is what the conversation already holds, not a folder of notes you keep open beside your work. Anthropic's own list of [the document types you can upload](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/8241126-what-kinds-of-documents-can-i-upload-to-claude-ai) is PDF, DOCX, CSV, TXT, HTML, ODT, RTF, EPUB, JSON and XLSX: Markdown isn't on it.

## A browser engine to read one file

VS Code is an Electron app: a bundled Chromium and Node.js runtime, not a native Mac app. The browser-extension route runs inside an actual browser. Either way, viewing one Markdown file means a full browser engine is running to show it. MarsDawn is a native AppKit app: no bundled browser runtime, it opens any local file directly, with no extension to install or permission flag to remember.

- [Reading notes: Lilian Weng](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/reading-notes/lilian-weng-llm-agents/index.md): Lilian Weng's widely cited 2023 survey describes an LLM agent as a brain plus planning, memory and tool use.
