# Viewing Markdown elsewhere, vs. MarsDawn.

If you already have VS Code, a browser or Claude Desktop open, reaching for one of them to glance at a Markdown file is reasonable. Here's what each one actually renders, and what it costs to get there, compared with opening the same file in MarsDawn.

## At a glance

|  | VS Code preview | Browser extension | Claude Desktop | MarsDawn |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Opens a Markdown file from disk | Yes | Yes, once file access is allowed | No: Markdown isn't on its upload list | Yes |
| Before the first file | Install VS Code, a whole development environment | Install an extension, then turn on “Allow access to file URLs” | It can't browse files on disk | Install MarsDawn |
| Built for | Writing code; the preview is one pane among many | Browsing the web | Conversations with Claude | Reading and editing Markdown |
| Draws the page with | Electron: a bundled Chromium and Node.js | A full browser | The Claude Desktop app | A native AppKit app; WebKit draws the page |

## VS Code's built-in preview

Press `⌘⇧V` in VS Code and it renders the Markdown file in a built-in preview pane, free, with nothing to install. As of VS Code 1.121 (May 2026), that preview also renders Mermaid diagrams natively — Microsoft folded a Mermaid extension into VS Code itself, so this used to need a separate extension and no longer does. What it doesn't do: it's a preview pane inside an editor, not an editor built for reading — the pane sits next to a file tree, a terminal and every other panel VS Code can show, and VS Code itself is an Electron app you install as a whole development environment, not something you open to read one file.

## A browser extension for local files

No single browser extension dominates for reading a local `.md` file: Local Markdown Viewer, Markdown Viewer, MarkView and others all do roughly the same thing, and none is a default. Every one of them needs the same extra step before it can open anything: turning on "Allow access to file URLs" for that extension, because browsers block extensions from reading `file://` pages by default. That's a permission you grant once per extension, and it's easy to forget you did it, or why. Once it's on, the file renders in a browser tab, which means running a full browser to look at one file.

## Claude Desktop's file preview

Claude Desktop shows a file that's already in a Project or a conversation. What it isn't built for is browsing arbitrary files on disk — what you can look at is what the conversation already holds, not a folder of notes you keep open beside your work. Anthropic's own list of [the document types you can upload](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/8241126-what-kinds-of-documents-can-i-upload-to-claude-ai) is PDF, DOCX, CSV, TXT, HTML, ODT, RTF, EPUB, JSON and XLSX: Markdown isn't on it.

## A browser engine to read one file

VS Code is an Electron app: a bundled Chromium and Node.js runtime, not a native Mac app. The browser-extension route runs inside an actual browser. Either way, viewing one Markdown file means a full browser engine is running to show it. MarsDawn is a native AppKit app: no bundled browser runtime, it opens any local file directly, with no extension to install or permission flag to remember.

- [Agent skill](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/cli/skill/index.md): One file your coding agent loads to install marsdawn, check it works, export Markdown to PDF and read the JSON result.
- [MCP server](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/cli/mcp/index.md): marsdawn has no AI model of its own, so it doesn't matter which agent wrote the Markdown. Call it from the CLI, a skill file, or the marsdawn-mcp MCP server: all three run the same export.
- [Token-efficient review](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/token-efficient-review/index.md): A person reviews the rendered page in MarsDawn, never read back into the agent's context. The tool call itself returns a compact JSON result, not the rendered content, so calling it is cheap too.

- [Editor's reading notes](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/reading-notes/index.md): Six short notes on what the people building AI agents actually argue — Anthropic, Chip Huyen, Lilian Weng, Harrison Chase, LangChain and Andrew Ng — and what each one means for the person who has to read what such an agent hands back.
- [Reading notes: Anthropic](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/reading-notes/anthropic-building-effective-agents/index.md): Anthropic's December 2024 guide for people building agents separates workflows from agents and describes five workflow patterns, including one where a second LLM call reviews the first. What that means for what lands in your folder.
- [Reading notes: Chip Huyen](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/reading-notes/chip-huyen-agents/index.md): Chip Huyen's January 2025 essay on agents splits their actions into read-only and write actions. Why that split is a fast way to spot the line in a plan worth a closer look before you approve it.
- [Reading notes: Lilian Weng](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/reading-notes/lilian-weng-llm-agents/index.md): Lilian Weng's widely cited 2023 survey describes an LLM agent as a brain plus planning, memory and tool use. What each part tends to leave behind for you to read, and the limitation she names in plans that don't adjust to surprises.
- [Reading notes: Harrison Chase](https://marsdawn.southern-light.dev/reading-notes/harrison-chase-what-is-an-agent/index.md): Harrison Chase's 2024 definition of an agent and his spectrum of agentic behavior, and his case for observability as a system moves along it — read from the side of whoever reads the file it hands back.

Where that pipeline still hands a step to a person, and where it doesn't.
